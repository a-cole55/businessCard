            <p>
                After nearly a decade in higher education, I have decided to take my creative, problem-solving skills into software development.
                As a Full Stack Developer, I approach each project with the client in mind. My goal is to create a pleasant user experience by integrating an aesthetically pleasing user interface with optimal site functionality.

        </div>
